## You did not change `is_png_chunk_valid` in this lab, does it affect the performance of libFuzzer's default mutator? What about the example PNG mutator and your custom YOLO PNG mutator?

## How many PCs are covered within `100000 fuzzing runs` with your `fuzzer_store_png_rgba`, equipped with libFuzzer's default mutator, the example PNG mutator, and your custom YOLO PNG mutator separately? Do these numbers reflect the extent to which `store_png` has been tested?

## Do you think the mutator you customized (that aims at only generating well-formatted YOLO PNG inputs) helpful for finding bugs in `load_png`? Why?
