# My head explodes

I tried to reconstruct the source code. It was awful and a big mess. Reading closely the very first operations executed, I realised that the modulo local_28 stuff was making it quite easy to get local_28 close to 0. Also, uVar2 is often close to 0 also with the last operations so yeah, after a few iterations by inputting local_28 being equal to local_24, I got the flag.

Not really understood but it worked, "à la guerre comme à la guerre".
